Script Documentation: Auto Update + Autostart Setup for CapUnit Flutter App
ðŸ§  Purpose
This script is designed to:

Automatically check for updates of a Flutter app called CapUnit.
Download and install new versions if available.
Set up autostart mechanisms using both Wayfire config and XDG .desktop file.
Log all actions to a file.
ðŸ§¾ Step-by-Step Breakdown
ðŸ”¹ 1. Identify the Current User and Environment
Detects the user running the script (whoami) and resolves their home directory.
Redirects all output to a log file at ~/update_log.txt.
bash
ROOT_USER=$(whoami)
ROOT_HOME=$(eval echo "~$ROOT_USER")
exec > >(tee -a "$LOG_FILE") 2>&1
ðŸ”¹ 2. Define Key Paths and URLs
Defines paths to:

App directory (~/capunit)
Version file (version.txt)
Update JSON URL from GitHub
Wayfire config path (~/.config/wayfire.ini)
Example settings file (example.txt)
ðŸ”¹ 3. Ensure jq Is Installed
If jq is missing, it automatically installs it using apt-get.
bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y jq
ðŸ”¹ 4. Create App Folder If Missing
Ensures ~/capunit exists to store app files.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Create example.txt with Default Settings
If not already present, creates example.txt with basic JSON settings.

ðŸ”¹ 6. Ensure Wayfire Configuration
Ensures ~/.config/wayfire.ini exists.
Appends [autostart] and [window-rules] for CapUnit if not already present:
Auto-starts the app
Launches it fullscreen, borderless, maximized, and always on top
Places it on output HDMI-A-2
ðŸ”¹ 7. Create .desktop Autostart File
Ensures ~/.config/autostart/ exists.
Creates capunit.desktop to auto-launch the app using the standard XDG method.
Ensures it is executable.
ini
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Exec=/home/pi/capunit/capunit
...
ðŸ”¹ 8. Fetch Latest Version Info from GitHub
Downloads a remote JSON file with latest version info.
Extracts:
version: version number
url: URL to download the .tar.gz archive
ðŸ”¹ 9. Compare with Installed Version
Compares version.txt with the latest version.
If different, proceeds to update.
ðŸ”¹ 10. Download and Install the Update
Downloads the .tar.gz archive to /tmp/myapp.tar.gz
Clears existing app files from ~/capunit
Extracts new files into ~/capunit
Updates version.txt
ðŸ”¹ 11. Restart the App
Checks if the app is already running and kills it.
Restarts the app in the background using nohup.
ðŸ”¹ 12. Final Output
Displays success or "already up-to-date" message.
Logs end time of update check.
